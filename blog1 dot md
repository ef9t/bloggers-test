# Building a Serverless Blog with GitHub Gists

GitHub Gists are typically used for sharing code snippets, but they can be much more powerful. In this post, I'll show you how to build a completely serverless blog using Gists as your content management system.

## Why Gists?

- Version control built-in
- Markdown support
- Raw file access
- Free hosting
- API access

## Implementation

First, we need a master JSON file that acts as our content index. This lives in a Gist and contains metadata about all our posts:

```json
{
  "blogs": [
    {
      "title": "Building a Serverless Blog with GitHub Gists",
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "gistUrl": "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/123456/raw",
      "slug": "serverless-blog-gists"
    }
  ]
}
```

## The Architecture

1. Store blog posts as markdown files in individual Gists
2. Create a master JSON file with post metadata
3. Build a static frontend that fetches and renders content

## Code Example

Here's how to fetch and render a Gist:

```javascript
async function fetchPost(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const markdown = await response.text();
  return marked.parse(markdown);
}
```

## Benefits

This architecture is extremely scalable and requires zero maintenance. Since GitHub handles all the hosting and version control, you can focus entirely on writing content.
